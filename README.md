- [Atlas](https://github.com/Atlas-OS/Atlas) - An open and lightweight modification to Windows, designed to optimize performance, privacy and usability.
- [Rufus](https://github.com/pbatard/rufus) - Rufus is a utility that helps format and create bootable USB flash drives. Create your bootable Windows installation media with this to circumvent the need for a Microsoft account & hardware TPM.

  <sup><sub>\*Specifically</sub></sup>
  - [Dot Hide](https://windhawk.net/mods/dot-hide) - Dot Hide is a handy mod designed to bring the Linux-style hiding of dot files and directories to Windows. In Linux, files and directories starting with a dot ('.') are hidden by default, but this isn't the case in Windows.
    Dot Hide tackles this by automatically hiding these files and directories, creating a more streamlined and organized workspace.
  - [Modernize Folder Picker Dialog](https://windhawk.net/mods/modernize-folder-picker-dialog) - This mod replaces the outdated, hard-to-use "Browse For Folder" dialog with a modern styled folder picker dialog, which is easier to navigate.
  - [Taskbar Thumbnail Reorder](https://windhawk.net/mods/taskbar-thumbnail-reorder) - Reorder taskbar thumbnails with the left mouse button.
  - [Taskbar tray system icon tweaks](https://windhawk.net/mods/taskbar-tray-system-icon-tweaks) - Allows hiding system icons (volume, network, battery), the bell (always or when there are no new notifications), and the "Show desktop" button. **This lets you hide the system volume icon, since we will use the EarTrumpet app to manage audio devices.**
  - [Windows 11 Start Menu Styler](https://windhawk.net/mods/windows-11-start-menu-styler) - Customize the start menu with themes contributed by others or create your own.
- [Windows Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal) - The new Windows Terminal and the original Windows console host, all in one.
